### Client App Package

####  Running the client

1. Configure the client application via a `.env` file (example at [sample.env](sample.env))

2. Run the client:
    `pnpm run dev` to run watching changes
    `pnpm run preview` to run without watching for changes
    `pnpm run build` to build when using in deployments

#### Documentation

See the [Config](./src/config/config.ts#L25-L33) interface for all available client configuration options (also documented in the application API documentation)
